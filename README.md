This is my submission for the Module 2 VBA challenge.

My upload should contain three screenshots of the completed Multipe_year_stock_data sheet along with the VBA script I wrote to complete the assignment. I generated most of the code by myself but gained assistance from chatGPT, the bootcamp spot virtual assistant, and Google when I ran into trouble. I bounced ideas off colleagues as well.

The VBA script exported from excel with a .bas suffix. If this is incorrect, let me know and I can update it.
